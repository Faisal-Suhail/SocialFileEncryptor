# Social File Encryptor
## Brief project description
This is a file encryption system. What's unique about it is that it allows you to share decryption privileges with friends so that they can also decrypt your files if you wish so.
## My role in the project
I was the project leader (planning, decision making, and role assignment).
I developed the domain layer of the project.
